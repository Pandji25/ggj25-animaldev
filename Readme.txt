How we make the game

first we drink coffee and then we brainstorm

we pick the running from a chaser concept because we think its cool and doable in 2 days

we code the base gameplay in godot while some of us drawing most of the asset on our prefered software (Krita and CSP)

after we have the base gameplay, we add the UI element and starts to put the asset to use

we having difficulty with shader in godot to make the main menu, so we did it in blender instead and export it as video asset

after all asset are implemented, we start to make the stage procedural

although we havent polish the gameplay, we manage to make everything works

that is the process of our game making :D
